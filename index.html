			  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
			<p>Computer is common around our society. My first interest in IT happened when I saw codes on the screen of injured laptop. Although my major in RMIT is accounting, I acknowledge that most offices in workplace may include information technology, even simple thing such as data entry and storage. I believe that learning IT can help me to have a better understanding of basic computer software and HTML. That can become extra knowledge for my life.</p>

 			<p>This is a job of accounts officer. The main duties are recording payroll, accounts reconciliation, monthly report and so on. Besides accounting skill, the job also requires knowledge of MYOB, a computer software. In modern days, information technology is included in every career. There is need for IT skill to record accounts receivable and payable such as MYOB, Excel, create a website, catch up on new technology, etc.</p>                      
			<p>I am currently studying accounting as major, which is about taxation law, organization behavior, data entry, etc. By learning all those skills from Bachelor may fulfil the skill requirement for basic accountant job. Then I need to gain experience from accounting firms to apply for a graduate accountancy job. </p>

			<p>The test results show my way of living briefly and analyse my attitude at work. Big Five Personality test judge that I prefer not seeking much attention from others and also prefer corporate instead of compete as the extraversion is 40% and agreeableness is 58%. The results may not be 100% correct and won’t affect my taste of choosing a group. But now I have a clearer figure of my role in a team.</p>

			  <h1>Project ideas</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>The idea of this project will be create a FAQ and implement it as a chatterbot or chatbot, involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software. The purpose is to make the experience more convenient and less stress for the business organisation and customer. In the end the organisation can study customer needs and wants through the chatterbot. </p>
			<p>The project requires tools and technology such as GitHub, language program software and obviously functional computer. Suitable skills for using them are webpage setup and maintenance skill, version control facility, language program, and communication skill.</p>

			<h2>Motivation: Description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence</h2> 
			<p>Imagine your role as a in a customer service counter, you need to handle many customer phone call or message every day. Some of those calls are questions needs proper knowledge which only you would know; some of them can be silly questions, unreasonable customer or spam. If you insert FAQ in the company webpage, people search the basic answers for themselves without waiting for phone line and message reply. And furthermore, it’s 2019 now. Create a chatterbot lets people quicker to find out the answer. Unlike FAQ, people feel more like talking to a person even they know that it’s an AI made by code and program. </p>

			<h2>Description: Detailed description of the features of the product or service</h2>
			<p>Firstly, prepare the FAQ in the company webpage. Without categorise the list of questions and answer, it would be hard and trouble to create the chatterbot from nothing. In other words, most chatbot answers are based on FAQ. If there is any new information, the FAQ shall sync with the chatbot. Some clients may be lazy not to read the words and call the company directly. That’s why we need chatbot at any page of the website to encourage the people to use the self-serving service.</p>       
			<p>The following components are features I suggest for the chatterbot.</p>
			<p>The first sentence in the chatterbot starts with ‘Hello, I am your personal assistant. May I help you?’ This is a common form of greeting by an assistant. AI may use the speech-to-text software to speak out the words because it shows an active helpful attitude. Then there are options shown under the greeting, in bubbles. Those options represent different categories of the most frequently asked questions. If people aren’t sure what they really want, the chatterbot can provide a ‘speech-to-text’ function for them to speak out their question. Sometime customers may not understand the information just by words, so AI can use pictures as support tools. As I want the conversation will not be too robotic and boring, emojis should be used to make the conversation be helpful and friendly. However, setting too much emojis will bring up a bad image for the company so I need to be careful of the usage. On the other hand, chatterbot shows empathy about negative events happen on the customer, rather than nonchalance. </p>
			<p>During the conversation, there may be time when the customer is lost in mind or forgets to close the chatterbot by any reason. The solution of these situations is set up a program of the AI asks ‘Are you leaving the conversation?’ If there is no reply after a certain amount of time, leave a comment of “I see you are unavailable. Conversation ends.”, as a record and end the conversation.</p>
			<p>If a request exceeds the chatterbot’s abilities, the AI will transfer the problem to human agents. It also records the data so that I can learn how to improve the product development from the failure. </p>
			<p>If the conversation ends properly, AI will ask the person to give a feedback in full marks of 5 and in details if the person is willing to do so. Also, the company’s Twitter link address (or other official related webpage) are provided. Customer can learn that there are other path to connect us. Chatbot also use the stored data to remember the customer’s name and interest. The same customer will be more enjoyable next time if the AI recognise his name as a human does.</p>
			
			<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
			<p>The following items are software, hardware and/or other equipment needed for the project.</p>

			<h2>Skills required</h2>
			<p>In order to complete this project, you need skills such as...</p>

			<h2>Outcome: If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</h2>    
			<p>xxx</p>
			<p>In nowadays, accountant and many jobs are seen to be taken over by high technologies. However, one thing that robot and AI can do but not master is understand the client’s needs and goals. Using my major subject, accounting as example, accounting in common is to group transaction and analyse people’s organisational behaviour. Chatterbot can suggest simple answers such as a certain type of plan the client may choose. But human is better at observing others and provide a more accurate advice.</p>
